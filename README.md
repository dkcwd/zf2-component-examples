Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager
==================================

<<<<<<< HEAD
A repository of examples where each major component class example is managed within a branch named after the relevant component class.

Since the fully qualified namespace of a class is not acceptable as a branch name an alternative format will be used which closely resembles the fully qualified namespace of a class.  For example `Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager` examples will be located in branch `Zend/ServiceManager/ServiceManager`.
=======
This branch is for holding examples of Zend\ServiceManager\ServiceManager
